I'm currently a PhD student in Computational Cognition at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I do research on the structure and measurement of phenomenal consciousness using computational tools and neural network models.

Before that, I studied Cognitive Science and Philosophy. 

If I'm not thinking about the mind, I'm either fulfilling CEO duties at [Learning Unlimited](https://www.learningu.org/) or fiddling with cameras and different gadgets.
